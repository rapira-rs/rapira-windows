# gRPC plugin

The plugin serves native gRPC over cleartext HTTP/2 on TCP sockets. Each PHP worker handles one unary application call at a time. Tonic validates requests and handles gzip. Identity responses use Rust-owned payload buffers. PHP receives and returns binary protobuf payloads.

## Configuration

```toml
[grpc]
listen = "127.0.0.1:9001"
protos = ["proto", "services/proto"]
import_paths = ["vendor/proto"]
reflection = true
interceptors = []
max_request_message_size_mb = 4
max_response_message_size_mb = 4

[grpc.compression.gzip]
enabled = false

[grpc.pool]
entrypoint = "grpc.php"
mode = "dispatcher"
processes = 4
```

Paths resolve against the configuration file. Use TOML literal strings for Windows paths, such as `protos = ['C:\app\proto']`. Protobuf import names use `/` separators. `protos` contains directories. Rapira searches them recursively for `.proto` files. Overlapping directories register each source file once. `import_paths` adds dependency roots. A service becomes an application service when its file is discovered under `protos`. Files loaded only through imports supply types and reflection data.

Import search roots use configuration order: `protos` first, then `import_paths`. Nested import roots retain their namespaces. Each import name must refer to one file. Discovered symlink file aliases cause a startup error; use one import name for each source file.

The server parses proto2 and proto3 schemas in Rust before the PHP interpreter threads start. Standard `google/protobuf` imports are built in and resolve after the configured roots. Missing directories, invalid schemas, missing imports, conflicting definitions, and application streaming methods cause startup errors. Each method route is `/package.Service/Method`. Service names come from the schema.

Message limits apply to protobuf message bytes. The `_mb` values use MiB. The `grpc.pool.processes` value sets the fixed number of gRPC interpreter threads. The `grpc.pool.max_requests` value controls interpreter recycling. HTTP and gRPC can run together with separate TCP listeners, entrypoints, and request queues. PHP module startup runs once for the process. Each interpreter thread has its own mode. Configure the HTTP interpreter threads in `[pool]`.

Gzip response compression is disabled by default. Set `enabled = true` in `[grpc.compression.gzip]` to enable it for application responses. The client must also advertise gzip in `grpc-accept-encoding`. Gzip requests are accepted with either setting. Message limits apply to the uncompressed payload in both directions.

Gzip can reduce bandwidth use for compressible payloads, but it uses CPU time. Keep response compression disabled when the CPU cost exceeds the bandwidth benefit, such as for random or already compressed payloads.

Schemas remain fixed for the server process. Interpreter recycling uses the prepared registry. Restart Rapira to load schema changes.

## PHP dispatch

`Rapira\get_dispatcher()` returns a `Rapira\Grpc\GrpcDispatcher`. Its `getServices()` method is available during application startup. Each service contains methods in descriptor order, with input and output message names.

`receive()` returns a `UnaryCall`. Use `getContext()` for method identity, request metadata, peer information, receipt time, and deadline. Use `getMessage()` for the protobuf payload. The application selects its generated PHP classes and decodes the payload.

- `respond(string $message)` completes the call with one protobuf response.
- `fail(Status $status)` completes the call with a gRPC error.
- `getResponseMetadata()` supplies the response header and trailer accumulator.
- `isCancelled()` reports host cancellation.
- `isFinalized()` reports completion.

The application must finalize its active call before it receives another. Repeated finalization throws `AlreadyFinalizedError`. A response after cancellation throws `WorkDiscardedException`. An abandoned call or an uncaught exception produces a sanitized `INTERNAL` status. Applications convert expected errors to `Status` and call `fail()`.

`Status` contains a `StatusCode`, a message, and `ErrorDetail` values. Each detail contains a protobuf type URL and serialized message bytes. The host encodes these in `grpc-status-details-bin`.

## Metadata and deadlines

Metadata preserves repeated values. Names are case-insensitive for lookup. Stored names use lowercase. Values for names ending in `-bin` are raw bytes in PHP.

Add text values with `addHeader()` and `addTrailer()`. Add binary values with `addBinaryHeader()` and `addBinaryTrailer()`. Response metadata rejects transport-reserved names. Both halves become fixed when the call completes. `headers()` and `trailers()` return immutable snapshots.

The host enforces `grpc-timeout` from request receipt through queue waiting and response waiting. The PHP context exposes the corresponding Unix deadline. Cancellation closes the waiting transport call. PHP can check cancellation while it runs. PHP execution time limits apply while a call runs. Ctrl+Break stops both listeners. A drain timeout returns exit code 1. If a PHP thread cannot stop within the shutdown budget, Windows terminates the server process.

## Interceptors and reflection

The Rust plugin accepts the shared `Middleware` and `Next` API as its interceptor chain. Requests carry `Protocol::Grpc` and `Peer` extensions. Each protocol has its own chain. Interceptors can inspect requests, initial responses, and body trailers. A final gRPC status can arrive in trailers after HTTP status `200`.

The standalone binary accepts an empty `interceptors` list. Rust hosts can supply custom interceptors through `Config::interceptors`.

Reflection uses `grpc.reflection.v1` and `grpc.reflection.v1alpha`. Both run in Rust and use the same interceptor chain as application calls. Reflection lists registered application services and reflection services. It also serves imported descriptors and custom protobuf options. PHP's `getServices()` lists application services.

## Deployment

Deploy the application's `.proto` files with the PHP entrypoint. Configure schema dependencies with `import_paths`. Schema loading runs entirely in the Rapira process.

Generate PHP protobuf classes during the application build with the application's protobuf toolchain. See [the echo example](../../../examples/grpc/) for a complete server and reflection-based client commands.

## Large payloads

Test connection count and concurrent calls separately. More concurrent large calls increase memory use and can reduce throughput. Measure CPU time per call and tail latency with the application's payloads.

Each PHP worker can retain one large request-string buffer until its worker cycle ends. This allocation counts toward PHP's `memory_limit`. Reuse requires all PHP references to the previous string to be released. Direct argument use permits reuse. For a persistent `$payload` variable, call `unset($payload)` after processing it. Reassignment evaluates the next `getMessage()` while the previous value is still live and requires another allocation.

A client's HTTP/2 receive-frame limit controls the maximum size of the server's response DATA frames. For large responses, test a 256 KiB limit. A Tonic client can set this with [`Endpoint::max_frame_size`](https://docs.rs/tonic/latest/tonic/transport/struct.Endpoint.html#method.max_frame_size):

```rust
let endpoint = tonic::transport::Endpoint::from_shared(uri)?
    .max_frame_size(256 * 1024u32);
```

The frame limit is independent of the protobuf message limit. Configure the client's message limit to accept the expected response size.
