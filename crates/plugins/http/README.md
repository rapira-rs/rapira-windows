# rapira_http

The http plugin of the `rapira` binary. It terminates HTTP/1.1 on the configured listener and answers every request from PHP. It has no upstream and proxies nothing.

## How it works

`Server` implements `rapira_sapi::plugin::Plugin`:

- `name()` returns `http`: the TOML table and the dispatcher name that PHP sees.
- `modes()` accepts the classic, worker and dispatcher modes.
- `php()` returns `PHP_PART`, the `PhpPart` of the plugin: `register`, the function that MINIT calls after the base classes to register the `Rapira\Http` classes, and `dispatcher`, the dispatcher classes of dispatcher mode.
- `prepare()` runs on the boot thread before PHP starts. It removes spool directories of dead processes and binds the listener with `PrepareCtx::bind`.
- `serve()` runs on the `rapira-http` plugin thread. Its `Worker` holds a two-thread tokio runtime handle, the PHP pool sink, the stop flag, and `drain_grace`. The plugin drains within this limit after a stop.

`serve()` wraps the pool sink as `Intake<Exchange>` and takes the prepared listener through `rapira_net::Acceptor`. The plugin checks each request and runs its middleware. It reads the body, builds an `Exchange`, and submits it to the interpreter queue. PHP produces response frames. The plugin writes these frames to the socket.

`Exchange` is the work unit. It implements `rapira_sapi::work::Work`:

- `cancelled()` returns true when the client is gone. `receive()` skips such a unit.
- `attach()` connects the unit to the `Rapira\Http\Exchange` object that `receive()` returns in dispatcher mode.
- `into_cgi()` gives the CGI request that the classic and worker modes run.
- `shed()` answers 503 when the PHP boot of the worker failed.

The client gets 503 when the intake of the worker stays full for 30 seconds, and 500 when the PHP thread of the worker has stopped. PHP does not see these requests.

## Crate layout

- `Cargo.toml`: depends on `rapira_sapi`, `rapira_net`, `rapira_config` and `rapira_static_files`. `rapira_php_build` is a build dependency.
- `build.rs`: compiles the C files with `rapira_php_build::compile`, against the PHP headers and the `rapira_sapi.h` directory from `DEP_RAPIRA_SAPI_INCLUDE`.
- `rapira_http.stub.php`: the PHP stub of the `Rapira\Http` and `Rapira\Internal\Http` classes.
- `rapira_http_arginfo.h`: generated from the stub by `dev.ps1 -Task stubs`. Do not edit it.
- `rapira_http.h`: the C layout of the exchange object and the class entries.
- `rapira_http_classes.c`: `rapira_http_register_classes`, the object handlers, and the method shells of the dispatcher classes. MINIT calls `rapira_http_register_classes` after the base classes.
- `rapira_http.c`: the method shells of the value classes `Request`, `FormField`, `UploadedFile` and `Multipart`.
- `rapira_exchange.c`: the method shells of `Exchange`.
- `src/lib.rs`: `Config`, `Server` and its `Plugin` impl.
- `src/config.rs`: `Section` (the `[http]` table), `Settings`, `resolve` with the boot checks, and `Server::from_settings`.
- `src/serve.rs`: the accept loop, one hyper connection per accepted socket, and the drain.
- `src/handler.rs`: the admission checks, the middleware chain, the body read, the submit to the intake and the response head.
- `src/middleware.rs`: the chain types `Body`, `Request`, `Response`, `Service`, `Layer`, and `Peer`.
- `src/check.rs`: the admission checks: `Host`, `CONNECT`, field names, declared length.
- `src/request.rs`: builds the SAPI `Request` from the HTTP request and the `Peer`.
- `src/response.rs`: the response fields and the error responses.
- `src/bridge.rs`: the reply body that streams the PHP frames and the `sendFile` slices, and the write timeout.
- `src/exchange.rs`: the `Exchange` unit and its `Work` impl.
- `src/multipart.rs`: the multipart parser and the spool dirs of dispatcher mode.
- `src/php/`: the Rust behind the PHP methods: the class entries, `PHP_PART` and `DISPATCHER_CLASSES` (`mod.rs`), `getRequest()` (`request.rs`), the head, body and trailer writes (`respond.rs`, `headers.rs`), `sendFile()` (`sendfile.rs`), the value class constructors (`values.rs`), and the unit tests of these parts that need no PHP (`tests.rs`).

## Middleware

`[http].middleware` lists the middleware names in chain order. The plugin builds one tower layer for each name and applies the layers around its inner service, the first listed outermost. Without middleware, hyper serves the inner service directly.

A layer is `middleware::Layer`: a `tower::util::BoxCloneServiceLayer` over `http::Request<Body>` and `http::Response<Body>`, with the error type `Infallible`. `middleware::Body` is an `UnsyncBoxBody<Bytes, BoxError>`. A layer answers a request itself or calls the inner service.

`Peer` is in the request extensions: the remote address, the server address, `https` and the receive time. PHP gets these values from it. A layer can replace it. The extensions also hold private state of the plugin: the request authority and the in-flight counter of the drain. A layer that rebuilds a request must keep the extensions. A layer must not keep them after the call.

The admission checks run before the chain. A request that fails them does not reach the middleware.

To add a built-in middleware:

- Put its layer in a new crate under `crates/middleware`.
- In the root `Cargo.toml`, add the crate to the workspace `members` and to `[workspace.dependencies]`.
- Add the crate to the dependencies in `crates/plugins/http/Cargo.toml`.
- In `src/config.rs`, add its table to `Section`, as `r#static` is for `[http.static]`.
- Resolve the table in `settings`, and give the result to `resolve_middleware` as a new argument.
- Add a variant with its settings to `config::Middleware`.
- In `resolve_middleware`, match its name, add the name to the known names of the unknown-name error, and refuse a configured table that the list does not name.
- Add its boot check to `resolve`, as `check_static_root` is for `static`.
- Build its layer in `Server::from_settings`.

`rapira_static_files::StaticFiles` is the `static` middleware. It serves files from `[http.static].root`. A miss goes to the next layer, and to PHP when `static` is the last layer. A permission error or a bad file name is also a miss. Any other read failure answers 500. That request does not reach PHP.

`StaticFiles` holds served files in memory. An entry stays fresh for one second. The HTTP plugin shares one cache of up to 16 MiB across its pool. It stores no file above 256 KiB. A permission change does not stop a cached file from being served. Delete or replace the file to stop serving it. A restart empties the cache.

## Request handling

- The request body is buffered before dispatch and capped by `max_body_size_mb`: a declared `Content-Length` over the cap answers 413 before the body is read, an over-long streamed body answers 413 when the cap is crossed.
- `Expect: 100-continue` is honored by hyper: the interim 100 goes out when the body is first read and is skipped entirely when the request is refused first.
- `Host` rules per RFC 9112 §3.2: a repeated, missing or empty `Host` on HTTP/1.1 answers 400. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.2
- Absolute-form request-targets are accepted. The authority of the target replaces `Host`, without the userinfo part. PHP sees the origin-form path and query; the request target keeps the full form. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.2.2
- `CONNECT` answers 501. The plugin implements no tunnels.
- A request body that makes no read progress for `keepalive_timeout_secs` answers 408 and closes the connection.
- `unsafe_field_names` guards the CGI variable mapping of the classic and worker modes: a field name with `_` or `.` lands on the `$_SERVER` entry a `-` name owns, so such names are dropped (default) or the request answers 400 (`"reject"`).
- Header field names reach PHP lowercased, one entry per field line, values in wire order per name.

## Response handling

- Responses stream; nothing is buffered beyond one frame per request plus the PHP-side frame channel.
- The plugin owns the framing: PHP-supplied `Content-Length`/`Transfer-Encoding` and hop-by-hop fields are stripped (RFC 9110 §7.6.1, including fields named by a `Connection` value), a PHP-declared length becomes the `Content-Length`, and hyper authors chunked framing when there is none. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.6.1
- A truncated reply (worker death, or a body shorter than the declared length) drops the connection without a clean terminator, so the client can tell the response was cut short.
- `sendFile` events stream the validated file slice in 64 KiB reads off the blocking pool.
- Interim (1xx) heads and trailers are dropped.
- `write_timeout_secs` bounds a single stalled write toward the client; a connection that makes no write progress for that long is closed and the PHP unit discarded.

## Shutdown

On the stop signal the accept loop ends immediately, idle keepalive connections close, and in-flight requests drain within the drain window (see Config); requests still running past the deadline are cut short and reported.

## Config

The `[http]` table. Unknown keys fail the boot.

- `listen`: `host:port` or `:port` for all interfaces. Default `127.0.0.1:8000`.
- `server_name`: what PHP sees as `SERVER_NAME`. Default `localhost`.
- `server_port`: what PHP sees as `SERVER_PORT`. Default: the listen port.
- `max_body_size_mb`: the request body limit. Default 8. A larger body answers 413.
- `write_timeout_secs`: the limit for one stalled write to the client, not for the whole response. Default 30.
- `keepalive_timeout_secs`: closes an idle keepalive connection, and limits each head read and body-frame read. Default 60.
- `unsafe_field_names`: `"drop"` (default) or `"reject"` for header names that alias a CGI variable. In dispatcher mode no `$_SERVER` mapping exists, so `"drop"` keeps the names and `"reject"` still answers 400.
- `middleware`: the middleware names in chain order, the first listed outermost. Default: none.
- `[http.uploads]`: the multipart limits of dispatcher mode: `dir` (default: the system temp dir), `max_file_size_mb` (2), `max_field_size_kb` (256), `max_files` (20), `max_parts` (1024), `max_part_headers` (32). This table under another mode fails the boot.
- `[http.sendfile]`: `root`, the directory that must contain each `sendFile()` path. Default: the entrypoint directory.
- `[http.static]`: the settings of the `static` middleware: `root` (required, an existing directory) and `forbid` (the file-name suffixes it never serves, default `[".php"]`).
- `[http.pool]`: the interpreter pool: `entrypoint` (required), `mode`, `processes`, and `max_requests`. `examples/rapira.toml` shows each key.

The drain window is `[supervisor].process_control_timeout_secs` minus the smaller of 5 seconds and half the timeout. The remaining time allows PHP teardown. The host forces exit if the full shutdown exceeds this budget.

Each of these errors in the middleware list fails the boot with exit code 1:

- `http.middleware lists "<name>" twice`
- `http.middleware entry "<name>" is unknown; known middleware: "static"`
- `http.middleware lists "static" but [http.static] is missing`
- `[http.static] is configured but http.middleware does not list "static"`
