# rapira_http

The HTTP front built into the `rapira` binary. It terminates HTTP/1.1 on the configured listener and answers every request from PHP through the `extension_api` bridge; there is no upstream and nothing is proxied.

## How it works

`Server` implements `extension_api::Extension`. The host's extension runtime runs without an IO driver, so this crate serves on its own tokio runtime (two workers, thread `rapira-http`) on a dedicated thread. `PrepareCtx` binds the TCP listener before PHP starts. The HTTP runtime takes ownership of that socket and adopts it with `from_std` in the single server process.

Connections are served by hyper's http1 builder. Each request runs through admission checks, the middleware chain, and the PHP handler: the request maps to an `extension_api::Request`, executes via `Php::exec`, and the resulting `ReplyEvent` stream is written back to the socket as it arrives.

## Middleware

`Config.middleware` holds an `extension_api::Middleware` chain, outermost first, shared by every protocol this plugin serves. A middleware sees `http::Request<Body>`/`http::Response<Body>` with `Protocol` and `Peer` in the request extensions, and either calls `next.run(req)` or answers on its own. The extensions also carry private per-request state for the handler. Keep the extensions when you rebuild a request. Do not retain them past the call. Admission checks run before the chain, so middleware never sees a request that was refused at the door.

Built-in middleware lives under `crates/middleware`, one crate per middleware. The `middleware` list in `[http]` selects the built-in middleware and sets the chain order. `rapira_static_files::StaticFiles` serves files from `[http.static].root`. A miss falls through the chain to PHP. A permission error or a bad file name is also a miss. Any other read failure answers 500. That request does not reach PHP.

`StaticFiles` holds served files in memory. An entry stays fresh for one second. A rewritten file therefore reaches the client after that time. The server has one process-wide cache of up to 16 MiB shared by all threads, and the cache stores no file above 256 KiB. `pool.processes` sets the PHP interpreter thread count and does not multiply the cache. A permission change does not stop the cache from serving a file. To stop it, delete the file or replace it. A restart empties the cache.

## Request handling

- The request body is buffered before dispatch and capped by `max_body_size`: a declared `Content-Length` over the cap answers 413 before the body is read, an over-long streamed body answers 413 when the cap is crossed.
- `Expect: 100-continue` is honored by hyper: the interim 100 goes out when the body is first read and is skipped entirely when the request is refused first.
- `Host` rules from RFC 9112 section 3.2: a repeated, missing, or empty `Host` on HTTP/1.1 answers 400. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.2
- Absolute-form request-targets are accepted. The target's host information replaces `Host`, without the userinfo part. PHP sees the origin-form path and query; the request target keeps the full form. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.2.2
- `CONNECT` answers 501 because this HTTP server does not implement tunnels.
- A request body that makes no read progress for `keepalive_timeout` answers 408 and closes the connection.
- `unsafe_field_names` guards the CGI variable mapping: a field name with `_` or `.` lands on the `$_SERVER` entry a `-` name owns, so such names are dropped (default) or the request answers 400 (`"reject"`).
- Header field names reach PHP lowercased, one entry per field line, values in wire order per name.

## Response handling

- Responses stream; nothing is buffered beyond one frame per request plus the PHP-side frame channel.
- The HTTP server controls framing. It removes PHP-supplied `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding`, and hop-by-hop fields. This includes fields named by a `Connection` value. A PHP-declared length becomes the `Content-Length`. hyper writes chunked framing when no other framing exists. RFC 9110 section 7.6.1: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.6.1
- A truncated reply (worker death, or a body shorter than the declared length) drops the connection without a clean terminator, so the client can tell the response was cut short.
- `sendFile` events stream the validated file slice in 64 KiB reads off the blocking pool.
- Interim (1xx) heads and trailers are dropped.
- `write_timeout` bounds a single stalled write toward the client; a connection that makes no write progress for that long is closed and the PHP unit discarded.

## Shutdown

On the stop signal the accept loop ends immediately, idle keepalive connections close, and in-flight requests drain within `drain_grace`; requests still running past the deadline are cut short and reported.

## Configuration

`Extension::init(config)` receives everything; `rapira serve` resolves CLI flags, `rapira.toml` and defaults into this struct and registers the extension.

| Field                | Meaning                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `listen`             | TCP address                                                               |
| `server_name`        | what PHP sees as `SERVER_NAME`                                             |
| `server_port`        | what PHP sees as `SERVER_PORT`                                             |
| `max_body_size`      | request body cap in bytes; over it answers 413                             |
| `write_timeout`      | bound on a single stalled write, not a whole-response deadline             |
| `keepalive_timeout`  | closes an idle keepalive connection; also bounds head and body-frame reads |
| `drain_grace`        | shutdown drain window; must expire before the host escalates its stop      |
| `unsafe_field_names` | `Drop` or `Reject` for names aliasing a CGI variable                       |
| `superglobals`       | whether a `$_SERVER` mapping exists to protect; `Drop` is inert without it |
| `middleware`         | the shared middleware chain, outermost first                               |
